Dynamic Programming is the concept that turn a 'big' problem into 'small' sub-problem
and then the sub-problems are optimized to find the overall solution 
â€” which usually has to do with finding the maximum and minimum range of the algorithmic query. 
Each time DP solves one of the sub-problems, it saves the results
and eventually put all the result it's saved together in oder to tackle the big one

    For example, when using the dynamic programming technique to figure out all possible results from a set of numbers, the first time the results are calculated, 
    they are saved and put into the equation later instead of being calculated again. So, when dealing with long, complicated equations and processes, 
    it saves time and makes solutions faster by doing less work.

The dynamic programming algorithm tries to find the shortest way to a solution when solving a problem. 
It does this by going from the top down or the bottom up:
    The top-down method solves equations by breaking them into smaller ones and reusing the answers when needed. 
    The bottom-up approach solves equations by breaking them up into smaller ones, 
        then tries to solve the equation with the smallest mathematical value, 
        and then works its way up to the equation with the biggest value.

Using dynamic programming to solve problems is more effective than just trying things until they work. 
But it only helps with problems that one can break up into smaller equations that will be used again at some point.
